# 🔍 Search Evolution with MCP  
A research & blog series exploring how Multimodal Contextual Processing (MCP) is shaping the future of information access.


## 🧠 What is MCP?
MCP (Multimodal Contextual Processing) is the next-generation approach to information search — embedded directly into tools, apps, and workflows. Instead of asking a search engine, your tool already knows what you need based on context.


## 📚 Topics Covered
 📌 What is MCP?
 ❓ Why traditional search is not enough
 🤖 Context-aware AI assistants
 🥊 Google vs. MCP: A new battle?
 💻 MCP in IDEs, Browsers & Productivity tools
 📖 Research references and case studies


## 📂 Repository Structure
• blog-posts/: All blog articles written in markdown
• references/: Literature review and external reading list
• images/: Diagrams and visual aids
• LICENSE: Open source license (MIT or CC)
